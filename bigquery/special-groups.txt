In a BigQuery datasetâ€™s access block, specialGroup is used for referring to certain built-in groups that Google automatically manages. The recognized values for specialGroup in BigQuery are:

projectOwners
projectWriters
projectReaders
allAuthenticatedUsers
allUsers
These special groups map to GCP-defined groups rather than specific individual emails. For example:

projectOwners: Anyone who is an Owner of the project where this dataset resides.
projectWriters: Anyone who is a Writer (Editor) for the project.
projectReaders: Anyone who is a Reader (Viewer) for the project.
allAuthenticatedUsers: Any user or service account with a Google Account who is authenticated.
allUsers: Any user on the internet (public access).
